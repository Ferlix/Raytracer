This script creates a scene, or only objects to add to another scene, for the raytracer containing one molecule of H2O.

The input is the xyz position of the central atom sphere (Oxygen).
The code will generate the two other atom spheres and their cylindric bounds using random vectors 



##### Input: ######
Run with ./a.out > (output_file.json)
i.e.      ./a.out > myscene01.json

-lenght of the spiral [lenght]
-position of the base [x, y, z]

i.e.       to draw an orizontal double spiral, from left to right, in a 400x400 image:
0 200 100 (position of central atom)
